flufl.enum - A Python enumeration package
=========================================

This package is called ``flufl.enum``, a Python enumeration package.

The goals of ``flufl.enum`` are to produce simple, specific, concise semantics
in an easy to read and write syntax.  ``flufl.enum`` has just enough of the
features needed to make enumerations useful, but without a lot of extra
baggage to weigh them down.  This work grew out of the Mailman 3.0 project and
it is the enum package used there.  This package was previously called
``munepy``.

``flufl.enum`` is an implementation of the standard library enumeration
package described in `PEP 435`_ for `Python 3.4`_.  It is available as a
separate package for use in older Python versions.


Requirements
============

``flufl.enum`` requires Python 2.7 or newer, and is compatible with Python 3.2
and later.


Documentation
=============

A `simple guide`_ to using the library is available within this package.  The
manual is also available online at:

    http://package.python.org/flufl.enum
